# Final-Project-Data-Science

# Overview
# This study is a collaborative work which combines individual-level data from 7 international prospective CKD studies. The primary interest of this study is to learn from the differences in CKD progression and its consequences across cohorts.

# Introduction 
# Rates of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular events (CVD) among individuals with CKD vary widely across countries.Well-characterized demographic, comorbidity, and laboratory markers captured for research cohorts followed prospectively may serve, in part, as surrogates for these factors. Our aim is to investigate to what extent core baseline characteristics of individuals with CKD explain differences in rates of outcomes across a diverse set of countries located on 4 continents. 

# This is a interdisciplinary study that involves physiscians, nurses, research coordinators, and biostatisticians responsible for running each study and the research group leading the integration process. We have applied epidemiological and biostatistics concepts to try to address may of the challenges associated with this project. For example, differences in study design and enrollment criteria followed by each study may have been responsible for a significant part of the differences in the incidence rates of events we observed. While most cohort studies excluded individuals with severe comorbidities like cancer or advanced heart failure, such patients were likely represented in studies based on populational registries. To help reduce the impact of this potential problem, we began follow-up only after individuals had been in the cohort for one year, thereby reducing the impact of events experienced by sicker patients soon after enrolling into health systems and being represented in their registries.

# Specific Study Aims:
#  We will compare 7 international prospective studies on chronic kidney disease assessing 3 different aspects: 
#  I. the variability in their baseline characteristics (age, sex, prevalence of diabetes, etc.) 
#  II. the variability in their rates of outcomes (CKD progression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD),all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular events (CVD)).
#  III. how the association between comorbidities and outcomes vary across these studies.
#  Our goal is to evaluate if differences in the distribution of risk factor explain the differences in rates of outcomes observed across these studies.
